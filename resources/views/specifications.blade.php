    <h1>Specifications</h1>

    <p>The purpose of OpenDiscovery is to facilitate the creation of a new data driven ecosystem for exchange of products and services.</p>

    <p>An important foundation for this is the use of standardized schemas and taxonomies for the description of businesses and their services. Fortunately most of these are readily available. Examples of standards, schemas, and data sources that will be used to the extent possible are listed in <a href="https://github.com/OpenDiscoveryBiz/publisher/wiki/Standards,-Schemas,-and-Data" target="_blank">the wiki for the Publisher component</a>.</p>

    <p>As the work progresses, this page will be extended to become a specification overview and placeholder for relevant links to individual more specific parts of the OpenDiscovery specifications.</p>
