    <h1>Business Publisher</h1>

    <p>The Publisher will enable business professionals to create and edit service descriptions for their business entities. This will be equivalent to posting business profile data, product catalogues, and related information on a marketplace or sharing platform. The resulting JSON data may be hosted directly by the Business Publisher or exported for subsequent upload to the business entity's own web servers.</p>

    <p>When ready for beta-use, an implementation of the Business Publisher will be made freely available as a service at this location.</p>
